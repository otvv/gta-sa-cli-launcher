# :keyboard: `gta-sa-cli-launcher`
This is a very simple launcher that I made to launch MTA San Andreas using the **Steam** version of GTA San Andreas.

I've built this mainly to be used on Linux through WINE, but it can be used on Windows just fine. (It's a Windows binary after all..)

**NOTE 1**: This launcher will replace the original GTA San executable, so make sure to rename it to `gta_sa.exe` in case you don't have the downgrade patch installed.

**NOTE 2**: Make sure to install MTA San Andreas in a folder called: _"MTA San Andreas"_ in the GTA San Andreas executable root folder.

_e.g_: `D:/SteamLibrary/Grand Theft Auto San Andreas/MTA San Andreas`
